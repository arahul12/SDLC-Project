## Pollard's rho algorithm

>Pollardâ€™s Rho is a prime factorization algorithm, particularly fast for a large composite number with small prime factors.
 It uses only a small amount of space, and its expected running time is proportional to the square root of the size of the smallest prime factor of the composite number being factorized.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Diffucult to implement Moodular Inverse due to Complex Calculation -> resolved through loops
2. Diffcult to find calculation of x2i,a2i,b2i -> later resolved
